<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Description of the
study</h1>
<p>This study (<span class="math inline">\(N~= 252\)</span>) replicated
the findings of Experiment~1b with three additional (fictitious) test
scenarios. Two versions of each scenario were tested. In one, both
category features had about equal diagnosability. In the other, the
status of the latent feature was harder to determine than that of the
evident feature. The goal was to demonstrate that the findings of
Experiment~1b that document an influence of relative feature
diagnosability generalize to other scenarios. One scenario was about a
newly discovered species of desert plant (the Desert Daisy). Two
sub-types were described (Type A and Type B), that were described to
occur equally frequent. Both sub-types shared the feature “pearly white
blossom”. The second feature varied between conditions. In the condition
in which both features had similar diagnosability, the unique feature
(the latent feature in the test case) was “thick green leaves”. In the
condition in which the latent feature was harder to observe, it was
“venomous liquid in its stem”. The structure of all three different
scenarios was identical. The second scenario was about a rare stamp (the
“Queen of the Caribbean”). The feature pairs in the condition with
similar diagnosability were “ultramarine” (evident feature in the test
case) and “yellow margin” (latent feature in the test case). In the
other condition the latent feature was “yellow sticky back”. The third
scenario was about Swiss watch (the “Weissentanner”). The shared feature
in both diagnosability conditions was “little Swiss flag on the dial”.
The latent features were “red digits” (similar visibility condition)
vs. “red battery cover on its back” (condition where latent feature is
harder to see). In the test phase, for all scenarios an exemplar was
described in which the information about the latent feature read “you
don’t know whether it also has [the unique feature] or not”. Subjects
then rated to which category the exemplar most likely belongs to.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Participants</h3>
<p>Two hundred and fifty-two subjects (<span
class="math inline">\(M_{age}\,= 39\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(SD_{age}\,= 13.65\)</span>, age range 18 to 74
years) recruited via the online platform participated in this online
study and provided valid data. The inclusion criteria were a minimum age
of 18 years, English as first language, and an approval rate (concerning
subjects’ participation in online studies hosted via prolific) of 90
percent. To ensure that all participants are able to understand the
written instructions, prolific workers with “no formal qualifications”
for the criterion “highest education level completed” were excluded from
participation. Subjects also were asked to take part via PC or Laptop,
and not via Tablet or Smartphone.</p>
<p>The study was planned for precision. The stopping rule for data
collection was that no 95% CI of the group means for the three scenarios
should be wider than 1.0. There should also be equally many subjects in
each conditions. This criterion was reached after 42 subjects per
condition.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Design, materials,
and procedure</h3>
<p>The study had two main factors, which were manipulated between
subjects. One was relative feature diagnosability, which had two levels
(both features similar vs. latent feature harder to diagnose). The other
factor was the scenario, which had three levels (Flower vs. Stamp
vs. Watch). An additional counterbalancing factor was the orientation of
the rating scale shown in the test phase (narrow scope explanation on
left side vs. right side). This led to a total of 12 between-subjects
conditions. The procedure was largely identical to the procedure of
Experiment~1b. Readers may use the link to the demo of the study.</p>
<p>The different scenario descriptions in the different “relative
feature diagnosability” conditions were (with the features in the
condition in which the latent feature was harder to diagnose in []):</p>
<p><u>Desert Daisy</u>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the desert region of Al Amanur between China and Mongolia,
botanists recently discovered a new kind of plant, the Desert Daisy.
There are two subtypes of the Desert Daisy, Type A and Type B. Both
occur equally often. Desert Daisy Type A has a pearly white blossom.
Desert Daisy Type B also has a pearly white blossom, but unlike Desert
Daisy Type A, it also has thick green leaves [it also has a venomous
liquid in its stem].</p>
You’re on a trip through Al Amanur desert and come across a Desert Daisy
that has a pearly white blossom, but you don’t know whether it also has
thick green leaves [the venomous liquid in its stem] or not.
</blockquote>
<p><u>Queen of the Caribbean</u>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the world of stamp collectors, the holy grail for any collector is
a stamp called “Queen of the Caribbean”. There are two subtypes of this
stamp, Type A and Type B. Both occur equally often. Queen of the
Caribbean Type A is ultramarine. Queen of the Caribbean Type B also is
ultramarine, but unlike Queen of the Caribbean Type A, it also has a
yellow margin [sticky backside that is yellow].</p>
You’re on a flea market and come across an old postcard with a Queen of
the Caribbean on it. The stamp is ultramarine, but you don’t know
whether it also has a yellow margin [a yellow sticky back].
</blockquote>
<p><u>Weissentanner</u>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the valley of Weissentann in Switzerland a watch manufacturer
produces a kind of watch that is the dream of any watch lover. It’s
called the “Weissentanner”. There are two subtypes of the Weissentanner,
Type A and Type B. Both are produced in equal numbers and are equally
expensive, which is why both types are found equally often.
Weissentanner Type A has a little Swiss flag on its dial. Weissentanner
Type B also has a little Swiss flag on its dial, but unlike
Weissentanner Type A, it also has red digits [a red battery cover on its
back].</p>
You’re on a train through the valley of Weissentann and you realize that
the person sitting next to you is wearing a Weissentanner. The watch has
the little Swiss flag on its dial but you don’t know whether it also has
red digits [a red battery cover on its back].
</blockquote>
<p>In each scenario, subjects answered the following test question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To which category of [Desert Daisy; Queen of the Caribbean;
Weissentanner] do you think this [flower; stamp; watch] belongs to?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subjects provided their ratings on an eleven-point rating scale with
the endpoint labeled “Definitely Type A”, the midpoint labeled “50:50
(both equally likely)” and the other endpoint labeled “Definitely Type
B”. The orientation of the scale was counterbalanced between
subjects.</p>
<p>Subjects also provided brief open-ended explanations of their
ratings. They then were asked two memory check questions and only the
data of subjects who responded correctly to both question were recorded
for analyses. The memory check probed the defining features of the two
types of entities presented in the scenario (run Demo of the experiment
to see the memory checks. To run the demo, click <a
href="Supplementary_Studies/ExpSup1/experiment_files/task_local_demo/Exp_demo.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>Subjects provide demographic information, were given the chance to
report technical complications they may have experienced, and then ended
the study on a short debriefing screen.</p>

</div>
<div id="results-and-discussion" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Results and
discussion</h2>
<p>A figure that shows subjects ratings in the three different scenarios
is shown below (squares are means, “+” are medians, error bars are 95%
CIs of the means, jittered dots show subjects’ ratings and violin plots
their distributions):</p>
<p><img
src="Supplementary_Studies/ExpSup1/data_and_analyses/results_scen_means_mainDV.svg" /></p>
<p>Subjects tended to prefer the narrow latent scope explanation if both
features had similar diagnosability (although there was no difference in
the watch scenario). Averaging over the scenarios, the following graph
shows the difference between these two theoretically relevant conditions
(squares are means, “+” are medians, error bars are 95% CIs of the
means, jittered dots show subjects’ ratings and violin plots their
distributions):</p>
<p><img
src="Supplementary_Studies/ExpSup1/data_and_analyses/results_means_mainDV.svg" />
<br></p>
<p>All statistical parameters and tests can be found in the knitted
R-Markdown Analysis file, which can be accessed <a
href="Supplementary_Studies/ExpSup1/data_and_analyses/Exp_Analysis.html">here</a>.
The analysis revealed that the means in these two conditions were
different from each other, which corroborates the hypothesis that
relative feature diagnosability influences subjects’ preferences.</p>
<p>The graphs also show that narrow latent scope biases were exhibited
only by a subgroup of subjects. A graph showing the different categories
of subject responses (and their proportions) is shown below:</p>
<p><img
src="Supplementary_Studies/ExpSup1/data_and_analyses/categories.svg" />
<br></p>
<p>All in all the results of this additional study complement the
findings of Experiment~1b and lead to the conclusion that past studies
who tested features with similar relative feature diagnosability tended
to overestimate genuine narrow latent scope biases. The reason is that
under conditions of similar relative feature diagnosability, subjects’
preference for the narrow latent scope explanation may be pragmatically
warranted: observing one feature but not knowing the status of another
that should be as easy to see is more likely to happen in a world in
which that latent feature is actually absent.</p>
