scenario_intro = `
<p><i>Please read the following fictitious scenario thoroughly:</i></p>

<p>
  Biologists have noticed a peculiar phenomenon in the duck population of lake Caldazzo, a remote mountain lake in Northern Italy: 
  Some ducks of lake Caldazzo happen to have blue feet (instead of the typical orange), 
  others happen to have blue beaks (instead of the typical yellow), and yet others happen to have both blue feet and blue beaks.  
</p>

<p>It was soon found out that these abnormalities are caused by genetic mutations existing in some ducks of the duck population of lake Caldazzo.</p>

<p>Three mutations explain the observed color deviations:</p>

<p>
    - A mutation of a gene called <b>PIX67</b>, leading to a <b>blue beak</b> and <b>blue feet</b>.<br>
    - A mutation of a gene called <b>TOX20</b>, leading only to a <b>blue beak</b>.<br>
    - And a mutation of a gene called <b>NAX20</b>, leading only to <b>blue feet</b>.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><i>A graphic summary of what these mutations do is given below. Please study this information carefully. 
  Your understanding of these mutations and their effects on duck color is crucial for the present study.</i></p>

scenario_intro_2_beak_unobserved = `
<p><i>Please read this additional information about the prevalence of the mutations:</i></p>

<p>
    The biologists managed to collect DNA samples from all the ducks of Lake Caldazzo.
    A laboratory analysis of these samples revealed that all three mutations occur equally often in the population. That means each duck has 
    the same chance of having the PIX67 mutation (causing both blue beak and blue feet), the TOX20 mutation (causing only a blue beak), or the NAX20 mutation (causing only blue feet). 
    Also, the mutations occur independently of each other, which means that having one of the mutations has no influence on the probability of having another mutation.
    The analyses the biologists conducted also showed that 5% of the ducks in the population have a blue beak.
