scenario_intro = `
<p><i>Please read the following fictitious scenario thoroughly:</i></p>

<p>
  Biologists have noticed a peculiar phenomenon in the duck population of lake Caldazzo, a remote mountain lake in Northern Italy: 
  Some ducks of lake Caldazzo happen to have blue feet (instead of the typical orange), 
  others happen to have blue beaks (instead of the typical yellow), and yet others happen to have both blue feet and blue beaks.  
</p>

<p>It was soon found out that these abnormalities are caused by genetic mutations existing in some ducks of the duck population of lake Caldazzo.</p>

<p>Three mutations explain the observed color deviations:</p>

<p>
    - A mutation called <b>BkFt2</b>, leading to a <b>blue beak</b> and <b>blue feet</b>.<br>
    - A mutation called <b>Bk1</b>, leading only to a <b>blue beak</b>.<br>
    - And a mutation called <b>Ft1</b>, leading only to <b>blue feet</b>.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><i>A graphic summary of what these mutations do is given below. Please study this information carefully. 
  Your understanding of these mutations and their effects on duck color is crucial for the present study.</i></p>

<p><img src="img/mutations_illu.png" width = 100%></img></p>

<p><i>If you've studied the information thoroughly, please click "Continue" to learn more.</i></p>
`;


scenario_intro_2 = `
<p><i>Please read this additional information about the prevalence of the mutations:</i></p>

<p>
    The biologists managed to collect DNA samples from all the ducks of Lake Caldazzo.
    A laboratory analysis of these samples revealed that all three mutations occur equally often in the population. Each mutation occurs with a probability of 5%. 
    That means each duck has a 5% chance of having the BkFt2 mutation, a 5% chance of having the Bk1 mutation, and a 5% chance of having the Ft1 mutation. 
    Also, the mutations occur independently of each other, which means that having one of the mutations has no influence on the probability of having another mutation. 
    It is therefore also possible for a duck to end up with more than one mutation. 
</p>

<p><i>Please click "Continue" to proceed.</i></p>
