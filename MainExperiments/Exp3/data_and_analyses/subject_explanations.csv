This means that each duck has the same chance of having any of these mutations. Additionally, the mutations occur independently of each other, meaning that having one mutation does not affect the likelihood of having another mutation. As for the percentage of ducks with a blue beak, the scenario explicitly mentioned that 5% of the ducks in the population have a blue beak. Therefore, my ratings were based on the information provided in the scenario, which emphasized the equal occurrence of mutations and their independent nature.
