The scenario provided specific details about two gene mutations, Mut-Bic2 and Mut-Taw4, along with their effects on blood levels (i.e., Mut-Bic2 causes abnormal Gludon blood levels, and Mut-Taw4 causes abnormal Gludon and abnormal Lian blood levels). It also mentioned that 10 out of 200 participants in a study had abnormal Lian blood levels (5%).
However, there was no information given about Patient #53's blood levels, genetic test results, or any other individual-specific data. Without this critical information, it is impossible to determine which mutation is the most satisfying explanation for Patient #53's physiological condition.
