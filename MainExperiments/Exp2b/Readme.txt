Replication of Exp. 2a

in 2a, the question was "what would be the most satisfying explanation" 

in previous studies, however, the question was "what is the most satisfying explanation"

The present study is a replication using the "what is the most satisfying explanation" phrasing, to compare it agains the "what is the most probable explanation" condition. 

The study also keeps the previous "what would be most satisfying explanation" condition.
