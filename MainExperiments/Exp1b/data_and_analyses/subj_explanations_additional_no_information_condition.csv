0HRR8HlfaNpE;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;While the hunter has a coloured headress it doesn't describe whether he has a golden tooth or if that is absent. So the chances are 50/50 without that information.
2bammSs4UfNo;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both hunters and spear fishermen wear feathered head dress. So could be either.
2bHpxVeBGS7w;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;As there is no mention of their teeth i cannot lean towards either answer. 
2eCCbFABd3KC;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;The person could be either because both fishermen and hunters wear colourful feather headdresses
2FAaiMgzUSSJ;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;All it says it that they have a colorful headress, there is nothing about a tooth mentioned, so they could equally be either one.
5OrTmugbD3o5;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both hunters and fisherman have the headdresses and they both form an equal split of half the tribe so it is equally likely that this tribesman is either of these groups.
9U0BSlFP7oe4;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;it said both of them wore the feathers that implies that everyone wore them.
AKwRwyEF2cpa;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;In the scenario we are not told anything about the subjects teeth, which is the main factor used in differentiating the two 
aT8JnIm0LhY9;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;As the only description I was given was that the tribe person was wearing a colourful headdress it could easily be either a huntsman or spear fisherman as no mention of a gold tooth was made.
Bo3f6Vxp0L2U;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Because I haven't been told if there is a gold molar or not, so they would appear the same at first glance. 
Es7toau07XSW;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;4;featherTooth;noInfo;It was 50/50 because they both wear the colourful headwear but I knocked it down a bit towards hunter because I thought maybe the golden molar would have been mentioned if it was a fisherman.
ft2l0MEWz2va;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both hunters and spear fisherman wear colourful feathered headdresses.
Ip6q4F3yuxrQ;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;All member of the tribe wear a colourful headdress. Half of them are hunters. Thus, the probability required is 50%
jssVCO4gHsN7;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both hunters and spear headman wear the same headband. 
qWl0vHOP3DV5;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;As both categories wear colourful feathers, the person is equally likely to be a hunter or a fisherman.
sfSAj7WrV2Kc;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both wear those headdresses. We cannot assume one has a golden molar tooth or not based on first seconds of interaction.
sHe16naBZEuU;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;3;featherTooth;noInfo;i cant be absolutely sure that he has the golden tooth only that he has a headdress - hence i think slightly more likely to be a hunter
tprEFHthQpv6;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;3;featherTooth;noInfo;Did not say whether or not they had a gold tooth. 
UDnGJLZ8j8XX;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;both wear headdresses so it could be either groups. i will need to know more information ie whether there is a golden molar tooth or not, to categorise the grouping further.
Ukq8MAqoKP2G;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both categories of tribesmen wear colourful feathered headresses so there is a 50/50 chance it could be either a hunter or fisherman.
vBNNnslVlWtj;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;The description simply states we come across a tribe member with a headdress. I have not peered into his mouth to his tooth colour, so he could be either a fisherman or a hunter
VIqdhQU4a0yN;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;They both wear this item so there is no way to tell.
YjbXufZIbzdN;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;going by the information provided we cannot tell which group they belong to because both groups wear headresses. we can only tell the difference by the one gold tooth.
Z95vXzVwsXEm;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Based on the information provided there was an equal chance of it being the either group
ZJrkEINuLAtu;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;noInfo;The hunters and fishermen are both Tokolo tribesmen and both wear colorful feathered headdresses. The additional identifying detail for the fishermen, the golden molar tooth, is not mentioned, but cannot be ruled out either.
0QCEuSMZsmMS;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;AS EVERYONE WEARS THE HEADDRESS UNLESS THEY OPEN THIER MOUTH YOU WOULD NOT BE 100% SURE THAT THEY WERE A SPEAR FISHERMAN 
1fKpf7RQyVA6;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;" 
 it wasnt clear wether he had a gold tooth or not so he could be either."
3rVDIi20dxJv;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Given that we know the tribe ALL wear headdresses, it can only be a 50/50 guess at whether the person is a hunter or spear fisherman, given the known information. However, a change in info (we now learn the person has a golden molar) would then change that probability.
72owZ2W91g8u;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Because both tribal members wear more or less the same headwear they are indistinguishable unless one of them showed their teeth.
bX4nZXg8L0ea;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Because both sides of the tribe wear the headdress, so there is equal chance he could be in either side of the tribe
cWjEKI8pnIBG;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both Hunters and spearmen wear the colorful headdress therefore unless you can see if they have a golden tooth there would be as much chance they are one of either so there is a 50/50 chance
dsPZnwCEfDdf;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;The sentence gave no indication if he had a golden molar, so the only evidence could apply to either group. 
E1gLtDKI0ARZ;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Since the information said that the tribe was half hunters and half fisherman and that both wore head dresses with the only difference being a golden tooth for the fishermen, it is equally likely that the person we ran into could be either. We don't know if we can't see their teeth.
elxGFeSVJaLr;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;10;featherTooth;noInfo;No addition was added to the head dress so I assumed that the person didn't belong to the spear fisherman
goBOGJEHgJZU;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;The text detailed that either tribe wear feathered headdresses so it could have equally been a member of either without further information on the molar of the person 
GTTsVF5QrYTZ;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;They both have head dresses but I wasn't told about their gold tooth so I couldn't be sure.
i1dG3g8kZqbr;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;both fisherman and hunter wore colorful headdress that why the person could belong to either tribe
ltMwHUSjaSP9;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both hunters and fishermen wear feathered headdresses so it 50-50% chance 
mp9x3AZM1Kld;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Both are equalyy likely to be the other because they both wear the same colour of headdresses and you cant see the gold tooth on the spear fisher man.
otbG3h1Vb6gi;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Since both the hunters and the spear fishermen wear color feathered headdresses, he/she could be from one of the 2 categories, so it's a 50-50 chance. If i see a golden molar tooth as well than I would know that he's a spear fishermen but without knowing if he/she has a golden molar tooth or not, it's a 50-50 bet.
PZLDpkmDX2GZ;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;both categories wear colourfu headresses, therefore they could belong to either
s2RI1yzWN7rD;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Since I only have one piece of information, the coloured headdress, which is shared between both parties, I do not have enough information to assume either way.
TGFLqTzg09iO;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;As both hunters and spear fishermen wear feathered headdress, there is no way which one is which without supplementary information therefore is equally likely to be either
uEufcniWx87X;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;8;featherTooth;noInfo;Based on the information provided, it is stated that the members of the Tokolo tribe are divided into two groups: hunters and spear fishermen. Both groups wear colorful feathered headdresses, but only the spear fishermen have a distinguishing feature of a golden molar tooth. Given this context, if I come across a tribesman wearing a colorful feathered headdress, it is reasonable to assume that they may belong to the group of hunters since this is the default category without the additional characteristic of the golden molar tooth. 
ujm5KlXsDmgn;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;There wasn't enough information for any better odds. I could interpret the fact that the text didn't mention his teeth and therefore assume that it's almost certainly a hunter but again, without other context or info assumption the other way could also be made. Given that it's a survey I guessed that this was exactly the premise that was going to be tested for and so stuck with the rational answer of 50/50
uZQ2NzAHU6Yw;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Because both members of the tribe wear headdresses you don't know if they are specifically fisherman until you see if they have a gold tooth. So you need to see them smile first before you make an assumption. 
wCgbd9e4ISdh;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;We are told that both wear colourful headwear and without further information we can not distinguish which group they belong to.
YJnTsWnLTtQb;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;Wearing of the headdress does not distinguish betwene the 2 because the distinguishing feature is not to be found in the headdress
ziMc0eZQUOnB;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;featherTooth;noInfo;You said both group wore a headdress and there was no mention of a golden molar tooth.
ZQIjz2dywC2v;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;0;featherTooth;noInfo;If its just one of them that have it then its definitely a fisherman 
6iTQxRqvmhr8;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;I felt as though it could be anyone because not enough information was given for me to reach a fully rounded decision. 
7GW30qeEmHsn;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;Because both sets of tribesman carry spears, it is statistically half and half
c9rzYZHBK5Bc;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;2;spearNet;noInfo;I assumed this answer because it wasn't made aware that the tribe was carrying the other item.
CMTOSdYOf774;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;We were told that half of the Tokolo tribe are hunters and carry spears and the other half are spear fishermen and also carry spears (although they also carry nets). Therefore, the chance was equal since they both carry spears.
DIsmxH28URIM;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;both of them carrier spears so they could belong to either, only the fishermen also carry a net and they only said they were carrying a spear.
ES9aLnLS5x2y;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;0;spearNet;noInfo;hE HAS A SPEAR FOR A REASON - AND THAT REASON IS HUNTING.
F86IOzkcuqkc;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;Both of the tribesmen would carry a spear so therefore the probability has to be 50%.
fmjyjJKVS3po;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;0;spearNet;noInfo;If he only had a spears he must be a hunter
ifUEVBzXaRqL;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;3;spearNet;noInfo;they have a spear but doesnt mention if they also have a net so could be either
J00zoRn7l3IT;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;0;spearNet;noInfo;i rated him has a hunter since he only had a spear, of course he could have lost his net in which case he would be a fisherman
KoaxrAxuiS9l;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;1;spearNet;noInfo;The fisherman always carry a net so they should have been carry both. However, there is a chance they may have not been carrying at the time so I didn't place my response all the way to the left.
MjxrGoImTLn1;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;all the tribemen carry spears, the only differrence is that the fishermen carry nets
MO8LhNilU4Ll;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;3;spearNet;noInfo;If they have a spear only and no net, they are more likely to be a hunter
N9EbIfcyuRpk;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;Both carry spears, the fishermen also carry nets along with the spear
qVGS11Py46eL;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;2;spearNet;noInfo;It's more likely to be a hunter as a fisherman would probably also be carrying a net.
RQVTsp6pkjLZ;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;Half of them are hunters with spears and the other half are fishermen with spears. So when I see a tribesman carrying a spear, I cannot tell whether he is a hunter or a fisherman. So it is 50:50.
T7Ld3nIpNUE0;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;The short segment talked about how both speared fisherman and the tribe have spears. I would think the fisherman are apart of the tribe because they have the same weapon.
Tf9ICzX9vZ6g;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;0;spearNet;noInfo;I would say Hunter only as the fisherman would also have his net with him. He would be unable to catch many fish without one.
tff3w0QnIqMH;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;There's an equal probability of it being either group as you didn't disclose the sizes of each group. So by default it'll be 50%.
u1sgl8q2jIhd;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;I saw a spear which meant that they could have been either a hunter or a fisherman, but I did not immediately see a net which would have confirmed either way.
UKOHutxtUMPa;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;Both hunters and fishermen carry spears so it is an chance that the tribesman belongs either group
uRBLAIFal9GR;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;4;spearNet;noInfo;It didn't mention that they had or didn't have a net so I sided slightly with the hunters on the basis it wasn't mentioned.
VCBFd8XOkwDt;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;It says that 50 percent of each belong to each tribe and they all carry spears so carrying spears does not tell you which it would be so therefore it has to be 50 percent chance of belonging to either.
vQkvcgv2MY7Y;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;Both hunters and Spear Fisherman carry a spear, so it could equally be either. It did not state whether they had a net on them or not. If it stated a spear and nothing else, we could confidently state it was a hunter or vice versa.
vROOdROwKxj9;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;spearNet;noInfo;The one group has nets and both groups have spears. Since the paragraph did not mention whether this person had a net also, it is impossible to know for certain to which group this person belongs. 
18OK5x7GVBxb;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;"Due to both job groups carry spears it could be either. If it said ""just"" a spear then it must have been a hunter."
2qDGihrv6h6q;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;both hunters have spears, so it could be either
32uP7MTxIr7U;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;10;spearNet;noInfo;If it was a spear fisherman they would carry a net as well as the spear.
7xeFLE3bATQy;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;we only know for certain he has a spear.  there is no information as to if he does or does not have a net.  since both fishermen and huntsmen carry spear, based upon given information there's a 50/50 chance 
bU7slro6Rd5W;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;10;spearNet;noInfo;It said he had a spear it didn't say anything about a net, so I believe he is a hunter
gpUAxO9mtiDl;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;All of the tribesmen carry spears. Half carry nets. This man carries a spear. he may also have a net - it just does not say whether he does or not. therefore he could equally be either of the two groups within the tribe.
hWORjjxg35Js;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;The description stated the tribesman had a spear - both hunters and tribesmen were said to carry a spear, so it is equally likely
iDJE8HhC2QY9;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;"I think it is 50;50 if the tribesman is a hunter or a fisherman as the scenario does not state if the tribesman is carrying a net!
If the tribesman was carrying a net as well as a spear it would make him a fisherman!"
idrnAFrdPKXx;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;10;spearNet;noInfo;"Fisherman also carry nets, but tribesman has a spear

"
Ili7UF7Cn8C6;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;9;spearNet;noInfo;as he was only carrying a spear i would think he was a hunter or some form of net would have been carried too
J7AOPyNymCAn;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;It doesn't say he didn't have a net. Since they both have spears, this is a 50:50.
Jcr8gKfShXXx;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;This rating is based on the fact that the whole tribe are using spears which means that unless the person is carrying a fishing net, they could belong to either of the work classes
LxSB4WtwUVYg;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;10;spearNet;noInfo;"Sure, it could've been a spear fisherman, but from the information given it could only be a hunter. I.E ""had a spear"". Having a spear doesn't necessarily mean he couldn't have another weapon but that's my reasoning behind it."
nM1jhH1ESusy;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;Because both the hunters and spear fisherman carry spears!
OvBFyNQ1xHT5;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;All tribe members carry spears, so it seems like a 50/50 chance.
PFc00G3L27WY;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;the group is split into two sides equally, both carry spears, so a random person it would be a 50:50 chance
RQXGFVkWbiin;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;Both groups carry spears and with no information on whether the individual is carrying a net it's not possible to choose a category. 
TKHfdkxNwwev;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;10;spearNet;noInfo;It only mentioned that the tribesman I came across was carrying a spear, so I assume that no net was also being carried, and that means that it would be a hunter instead of a fisherman.
TX7tF7Gztjv4;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;All the men have a spear. So it could be either. Though in reality a spear only carrier would be slightly more likely due to practicalities. 
ugT5NNLyMERE;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;Both carry spears. There are two tribes, so it's split half, 50/50. It could be either tribesman, so equally 50/50.
uXIgOzDFFcOs;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;All the tribespeople carry spears (just fishermen carry an additional item), so it is equally as likely - without additional context on where I am when I come across the individual - that it is a 50/50 chance.
WeTmh8gUyEF4;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;There is no mention of a net just a spear, and both use a spear
wzoC2ImtgVtm;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;8;spearNet;noInfo;I feel as if they were a fisherman they would have a net as well, not just a spear, but I split the difference between leaning towards hunter and possibly a fisherman.
xLHiLeecm0LI;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;5;spearNet;noInfo;the person had a spear. both hunters and fisherman have spears.
Yi8zMf1ul0M3;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_right;7;spearNet;noInfo;It's possible he can also be a fisherman and just not seen his net
