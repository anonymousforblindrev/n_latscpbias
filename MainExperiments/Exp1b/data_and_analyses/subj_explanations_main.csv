2MmqjXJmc4gB;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;notKnow;It would be difficult to tell whether the tribesman had a golden tooth as would be unable to see a molar at the back of the mouth unless the tribesman opened his mouth wide.

aSMUaOVYKVLz;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;narrow_left;5;featherTooth;notKnow;Why I made that decision is because they didn't state clearly that he has a golden tooth. there is a probability that he has a golden tooth or not so he can come from any of the 2 tribe.;1;0;0;0
