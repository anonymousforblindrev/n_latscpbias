<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Summary of the pilot
study<a name="summary"></a></h1>
<p>The main study implemented some changes based on what could be
learned from this pilot study. For this reason, the pilot study is
described here in greater detail.</p>
<p>The study used the same scenario as the main study, but only tested
condition with explicit rate information. In the pilot study, subjects
were given information about the base rates of the three different
mutations. However, the factor that is actually crucial according to the
inferred evidence account is information about the rate of the (latent)
feature(s). For this reason, the scenario description of the main study
deviated in this respect from the pilot study.</p>
<p>In the pilot study, the names for the three mutations were “BkFt2”
for the mutation causing a blue beak and blue feet, “Bk1” for the
mutation causing only a blue beak, and “Ft1” for the mutation causing
only blue feet. This was also changed in the main study, because these
labels tended to confuse some participants in a problematic way. I will
say more to this below when I summarize the results.</p>
<p>Another difference from the main study was the wording used in a
response option for the simplicity probes. The phrasing in the option
for the co-occurrence of both single-effect mutations read “This duck
has a Bk1 mutation (blue beak only) and a Ft1 mutation (blue feet
only)”. Apart from the new mutation names, this option in the main study
left out the words “only”.</p>
<p>The procedure of the pilot study was otherwise identical to the one
of the main study. Readers who are interested and prefer not to read the
text below may run the demo version of the pilot study. The link is
provided above.</p>
<div id="participants" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Participants</h2>
<p>Two hundred subjects (<span class="math inline">\(M_{age}\,=
37.44\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(SD_{age}\,= 11.10\)</span>,
age range 19 to 75 years) recruited via the online platform participated
in this study and provided complete data. The inclusion and exclusion
criteria were the same as in the previous studies. Subjects from
previous studies of this experimental series were excluded from
participation. The stopping criterion for data collection was a certain
degree of estimation precision of group means. To detect even small
narrow latent scope biases, it was decided that the 95% CI of the mean
should be <span class="math inline">\(\le~0.5\)</span> points on the
eleven-point rating scale. At the same time, there should be equally
many subjects in each condition (there were four between-subjects
conditions that resulted from two counterbalancing factors that will be
described below). This degree of estimation precision was reached after
<span class="math inline">\(n~= 50\)</span> subjects per condition (CI
width of overall mean <span class="math inline">\(=~0.45\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="design-and-procedure" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Design and
Procedure</h2>
<p>The study had a within-subject design as all subjects saw all
different test stimuli shown during the test phase. However, the
unobserved feature (beak vs. feet) of the narrow-latent scope bias probe
was counterbalanced between subjects. A second counterbalancing factor
was the orientation of the rating scale for that probe.</p>
<p>Subjects read a fictitious scenario about color abnormalities that
biologists detected in a duck population of a Northern Italian lake.
Subjects learned that some ducks have been found to have blue beaks,
blue feet, or both. These color abnormalities were found to be the
result of different independent gene mutations, called BkFt2 (blue beak
and feet), Bk1 (blue beak), and Ft1 (blue feet). Together with the short
scenario description, subjects also saw an illustration. The main
scenario description read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please read the following fictitious scenario thoroughly:</p>
<p>Biologists have noticed a peculiar phenomenon in the duck population
of lake Caldazzo, a remote mountain lake in Northern Italy: Some ducks
of lake Caldazzo happen to have blue feet (instead of the typical
orange), others happen to have blue beaks (instead of the typical
yellow), and yet others happen to have both blue feet and blue
beaks.</p>
<p>It was soon found out that these abnormalities are caused by genetic
mutations existing in some ducks of the duck population of lake
Caldazzo.</p>
<p>Three mutations explain the observed color deviations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mutation called BkFt2, leading to a blue beak and blue feet.</li>
<li>A mutation called Bk1, leading only to a blue beak.</li>
<li>And a mutation called Ft1, leading only to blue feet.</li>
</ul>
A graphic summary of what these mutations do is given below. Please
study this information carefully. Your understanding of these mutations
and their effects on duck color is crucial for the present study.
</blockquote>
<p>After this initial information, subjects proceeded to a new screen
where they learned about the prevalence of each mutation. They learned
that all three mutations were rare; they all had a prevalence of <span
class="math inline">\(5\%\)</span>. A low base rate was used because
this should increase the tendency to commit narrow latent scope biases
according to the inferred evidence account (Johnson et al., 2016).
Subjects also learned on that screen that the three mutations were
causally independent. They read: ``Also, the mutations occur
independently of each other, which means that having one of the
mutations has no influence on the probability of having another
mutation.’’.</p>
<p>Subjects had to pass a comprehension test. They had to answer three
multiple-choice questions testing (1) their knowledge of what the three
different mutations do, (2) their understanding of what it means that
the mutations are independent, and (3) their knowledge of each
mutation’s prevalence (for the exact wordings, see the demo provided at
the repository site). On a second screen of the comprehension test,
subjects provided ratings to three additional test questions that again
probed their understanding of the mutations’ prevalence, but this time
in a different format. This additional prevalence check was added to
ensure that it was as clear as possible to subjects that the mutations
and their effects are rare, which should boost narrow latent scope
biases according to the inferred evidence account. For each mutation,
subjects were asked: ``Imagine a perfectly reliable test that always
finds a [BkFt2, Bk1, Ft1] mutation in a duck if that mutation is
present. If such a test were to be conducted in a fully representative
group of 100 ducks, in how many of them would the test be expected to
detect the presence of a [BkFt2, Bk1, Ft1] mutation?’’ Subjects provided
their responses on 20-point, 5-steps, rating scales ranging from 5 (the
correct answer) to 100.</p>
<p>Subjects who passed the comprehension test proceeded to the test
phase. Subjects who failed the test were led back to the instruction
screen and then had a new chance to pass the test. The data of subjects
who needed more than three attempts were excluded from all analyses.
Subjects who passed the comprehension test were informed that they were
going to see a number of pictures of ducks that were captured by a
wildlife photo trap. They also learned that they were going to be asked
for the most probable explanation of the ducks’ appearances.</p>
<p>Subjects were shown five test pictures of ducks. The first test
picture always was one of the two possible narrow latent scope bias
probes. A prompt above the picture read: “The camera trap that was
installed at the lakeside took the following picture of a duck that
passed by”. Subjects then were asked the following test question,
displayed on the same screen below the picture: “Based on what you’ve
learned, what is the more probable explanation for this duck’s
appearance?” Responses were given on an eleven-point rating scale with
the endpoints labeled “Definitely a Bk1 mutation (blue beak only)” and
“Definitely a BkFt2 mutation (blue beak and feet)”, and the midpoint
labeled ``Both equally likely’’. Whether the narrow or the broad scope
explanation was on the left or the right endpoint of the scale (scale
orientation) was counterbalanced between subjects. As in previous
experiments, on a subsequent screen subjects were also asked to write
brief explanations of their rating.</p>
<p>In the remaining part of the test phase, subjects were shown four
probes without unobserved features. These pictures were shown in random
order. For each picture, subjects answered the following question:
``Based on what you’ve learned, what is the most probable explanation
for this duck’s appearance?’’ Subjects selected an answer from a list of
the following seven possibilities (this test question format was adopted
from experiments of Lombrozo (2007):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<p>As in previous experiments, the explanations of subjects who gave
unbiased ratings tended to point out the statistical facts of the
scenario. 69% of the explanations clearly described that both possible
mutations are equally likely to explain the test case’s appearance. For
example: “I couldn’t see the ducks feet so don’t know what colour they
are. It had a blue beak so it could have been either Bk1 or BkFt2. Each
of these has the same probability so I chose equal.”, or “We can’t see
the feet of the duck so we don’t know if it has blue feet. Therefore
there’s no way to determine which mutation of the two it has, so based
on all the information we have, we can only say there’s a 50/50
chance.”</p>
<p>A number of subjects who wrote correct explanations even explicitly
referred the mutations’ low (identical) prevalence: “because their is a
5% chance of getting a mutation of a blue beak and blue feet and a 5%
chance of getting a mutation of just a blue beak. So their both an equal
chance.”, and “Because they both have the same overall probability (5%),
the chances of the duck being either BkFt2 or Bk1 are equal. This is
because both of these mutations cause the beak to turn blue like in the
picture provided. We can’t see the feet of the duck but there’s a 50%
chance that they’re blue, and a 50% chance that they’re yellow.”.</p>
<p>The kinds of explanations of the subgroup of subjects whose ratings
favored the narrow latent scope cause varied more. Some indicated that
they expressed a preference for the narrow latent scope cause because
they misunderstood aspects of the scenario. An example is: “the chance
of a duck having both blue feet and blue beak is lesser than having just
a blue feet or beak.”. Some also wrote that seeing the undiagnostic
feature (blue beak or blue feet, depending on condition) would imply
that the mutation causing (only) that feature must be present and that
the mutation causing the unobserved feature might be present as well.
These subjects seemed to have thought that the broad scope mutation
(BkFt2) was actually a combination/co-occurrence of the two narrow scope
mutations (Bk1 and Ft1). An example is: “Definitely Bk1, but since we
cannot see the feet, there is a chance of ft1 aswell making it bkft2.
but we cannot be certain”.</p>
<p>Explanations that clearly described the process leading to genuine
narrow latent scope biases according to the inferred evidence account
were provided by 4% of the subjects. Examples are: “The blue beak was a
mutation. The feet couldn’t be seen as they were underwater but they had
a 5% chance of being blue as the mutation did not have any dependencies
on other mutations. So it was highly likely there was only 1 mutation”,
“It’s certain that the duck has a blue beak. It’s unknown as to whether
it has blue feet. Given the chance of yellow feet is much higher than
the chance of blue, I selected my answer accordingly.”, and “The blue
beak can be seen as a definite, but there is only a 5% chance that the
duck also has blue feet, so the probability dictates the duck will have
a blue beak only.”. Finding such explanations provides evidence that
these subjects (and possibly others who did not describe what influenced
them clearly enough) in their preference for the narrow latent scope
cause were indeed influenced by low feature base rate.</p>
<p>In sum, the results of this pilot study indicate that a salient,
explicit instruction of low feature base rates caused at least some
subjects to commit a non-normative narrow latent scope bias. However,
even under this “extreme” condition, most subjects still were not
biased. Most responded correctly and provided the correct explanation.
The results, therefore, also suggest that in scenarios in which feature
base rates are less salient, or not mentioned at all (as is the case,
for example, in scenarios like the Tokolo tribe scenario), reasoners’
tendency to be influenced by them seems rather unlikely.</p>

<p>Another goal of this study was to see if reasoners’ preference for
simpler over more complex explanations could be replicated, which would
provide converging evidence that reasoners explanatory preferences tend
to be normative.</p>
<p>The results for the remaining probes without unobserved features are
shown in Fig. 3. Each panel shows the distribution of explanation
selections for a specific probe. For the probe showing a duck with
“normal” beak and feet, all subjects said that the most probable
explanation was “no mutation”. For the probe showing a duck with a blue
beak, <span class="math inline">\(99.5\)</span>% (95% CI [<span
class="math inline">\(0.99, 1.0\)</span>]) said that the most likely
explanation was a Bk1 mutation. Similarly, <span
class="math inline">\(99\)</span>% (95% CI [<span
class="math inline">\(0.98, 1.0\)</span>]) said that an Ft1 mutation was
the most likely explanation for the probe showing a duck with blue feet.
The results for these three probes show that subjects correctly
understood the scenario.</p>
<p>The theoretically most relevant probe in this set was the one showing
a duck with both blue feet and a blue beak. Based on previous studies
documenting a preference for explanatory simplicity in such cases, the
prediction was that subjects would tend to say that a BkFt2 mutation is
the most probable explanation. The fourth panel in Fig. 3 shows that
this was the case. The BkFt2 explanation was selected by <span
class="math inline">\(90.5\)</span>% (95% CI [<span
class="math inline">\(0.87, 0.94\)</span>]) of participants; only <span
class="math inline">\(9.5\)</span>% of participants selected a different
explanation in this case.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Insights from this
pilot that led to changes for the main study</h1>
<p>A relevant insight from this pilot study was that the names of the
fictitious mutations are not optimal. This became clear from the
explanations that some subjects wrote. Some subjects expressed the
belief that the mutation causing to effects is actually a combination of
the two single-effect mutations. This belief might have resulted from
the way the mutations were called: <em>BkFt2</em> sounds like a
combination/ co-occurrence of <em>Bk1</em> and <em>Ft1</em>. A problem
is that subjects who believe this have a good reason to select the
narrow latent scope explanation for the narrow latent scope probe. To
avoid this confusion in the main study, the mutations there were called
<em>PIX67</em>, <em>TOX20</em>, and <em>NAX20</em>.</p>
<p>A second change in the main study concerns what base rate information
subjects received. In this pilot study, subjects received information
about the base rates of the three different explanations. What is the
driving factor according to the inferred evidence account, however, is
information about the base rate of the unobserved feature. This rate is
only indirectly (and only partly) given by the base rates of
explanations (because there might be alternative causes of the feature).
The decision was made to present feature rate information rather than
explanation rate information in the main study.</p>
